"Paradise Nursery" is an online store offering a variety of indoor plants. The app includes a login page, a navigation bar with links to key sections, and a product listing page that showcases plants in categorized sections such as Aromatic and Medicinal Plants. Each plant is displayed on a card with an image, description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button. The shopping cart page features cards for each selected item, showing a thumbnail, unit price, total cost, and controls to adjust quantity or remove items. Users can navigate easily between browsing and checkout using the “Continue Shopping” and “Checkout” buttons. The project emphasizes interactive features such as updating cart totals dynamically and reflecting item counts in the navbar.
